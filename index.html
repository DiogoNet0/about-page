        <p>
          Hi! My name's Diogo, I'm from Portugal and I'm 26 years old. I'm a
          freelancer Sound Designer and I'm currently learning web dev
          self-taught since May 2024. I'm having a great time learning all about
          web development, learning a lot about HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to dive deeper into Full-Stack. I've been learning more
          about backend development with Node.js and Express.js and I'm enjoying
          it a lot! I feel that I'm not very good at frontend... i still need
          practice.
        </p>

          <li>I want to get a job as a Full-Stack dev in the future.</li>
